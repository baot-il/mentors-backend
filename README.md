# mentors-backend

Backend server code for Baot mentorship application.

## Deploy a Local Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and verify installation.
2. Install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - version appear [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/baot-il/mentors-backend/blob/master/requirements.txt).
3. Install `pip`.

### Getting Started with DB setup 

â–º Either [via docker](#via-docker) OR [from scratch](#from-scratch).

#### via docker
1. Add the _Firebase_ credentials file dependency: 
   * Download the file from our Baot Slack.
   * Save the file as `firebase-local-env.json` under `secrets` folder (`touch secrets/firebase-local-env.json` and copy the details).
  
2. Run the following command in shell to setup _PosgradDB_ & _pgAdmin_:

```sh
./development/scripts/start-local-db.sh
```

3. Browse to `http://localhost:5050` in your browser and verify _pgAdmin_ page.
    * _pgAdmin_ Login:
      * Email Address / Username: admin@baot-il.com
      * Password: admin-password

4. Connect to your PostgresDB:
    * In the left menu, right click on the mouse and choose _Create_ -> _Server_.
    * Go to _Connections_ tab:
        * Host name/address: postgres-db
        * Port: 5432
        * Username: admin
        * Password: password
    * Click on _Save_.
  
5. Clean the docker environment by running the following command in a shell:

```sh
./development/scripts/clean-local.sh
```

#### from scratch
1. Install [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) (or your other favorite PostgreSQL GUI client).
   
2. In the command line, tun `docker run -p 5432:5432 --name baot-mentors -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=somePassword -d postgres`.
   _baot-mentors_ is the docker container's name and can be changed freely.

3. Connect to this DB using your PostgresSQL client with the following details:
   - host: localhost
   - port: 5432
   - username: someUsername
   - password: somePassword

4. Download _Firebase_ credentials file dependency: 
   * Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?supportedpurview=project&authuser=1
   * Click Create Key on the firebase service account.
   * Save the file as `firebase-local-env.json` under `secrets` folder.

### Running Local Server

**NOTE:**
You can **skip steps 2-4** below with:
- Create a `.env` file similar to `.env.default` and update with your own values.
- Run `start_env.sh` script which executes them for you (after first run disable/enable `python reset_db.py` as needed).

#### Setup local server
1. Install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   Consider using Python's virtual environment (`venv`) to prevent versioning conflicts.

   > :mega: 
   > If you're experiencing installation problems with `psycopg2`, try installing it separately using the command `pip install psycopg2-binary`. 
   > After the sperate installation, comment it in the `requirements.txt` file and re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Set the following environment variables (you can do so in PyCharm's run configurations):
   - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:<your local db password>@localhost/postgres`
   - `SECRET_KEY=someSecretStringUsedByFlask`
   - `APP_SETTINGS=config.DevelopmentConfig`
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./secrets/firebase-local-env.json` - for prod use FIREBASE_CONFIG instead

3. Run `python reset_db.py` to initialize the DB tables.

4. Run `python main_app.py` and verify (using the console output) that the server is running.

5. Browse to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and verify you get a _Hello World_ page.

## Project Structure

- _main_app.py_: This file runs the application instance. Heroku knows to run this
  file as it is pointed to by _Procfile_ (using _gunicorn_).
- _app.py_ - defines the application, its configuration and the DB.
- _config.py_: declares different configuration schemes for the application. The configuration
  is set to an environment variable `APP_SETTINGS`.
- _models.py_: defines the DB model. Each class is a DB table.
  Refer to [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/) ORM for
  more details and documentation.
- _views.py_: This file contains all application routing. Namely, it is
  responsible for all exposed APIs.

### Heroku Files

- _Procfile_ tells Heroku which process to run on initialization.
- _runtime.txt_ tells Heroku which Python version it should use.

## DB Migrations

To perform changes on the DB, follow these guidelines:

1. Backup the database's current state (you can do this
   [manually](https://data.heroku.com/datastores/35002e65-a561-4a72-a47c-c81b3cec2aa3#durability)
   from the database's resource page on Heroku).
2. Edit _migrate.py_ to perform the desired operations on the DB.
   Use [Peewee's Schema Migrations](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#migrate)
   documentation and examples.
3. Make sure you edit _models.py_ to reflect your new schema.
4. Once the script is final (and tested locally! :wink:), push it to the remote
   repository.
5. Run it on the staging app with `heroku run python migrate.py --app baot-mentors-stage` (you'll need
   [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)).
6. Do the same with production: `heroku run python migrate.py --app baot-mentors-prod`

To apply migrations to the local DB (and if you don't mind losing all local data) -
simply run _reset_db.py_ which will re-create the DB according to the schema in _models.py_.

## Tips & Tricks :smile:

- `heroku logs --app <app_name>` to show recent logs (use after crash...).
- Both staging and production applications deploy automatically from `master`.
